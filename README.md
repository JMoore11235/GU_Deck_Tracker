# Gods Unchained Deck Tracker<br>

## Overview<br>

#### Most recent release: 3-0
#### Most recent YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B42AySfLKwg 

This GitHub contains 2 main files (besides this README, a change log, and a folder containing previous versions of this deck tracker): a python file and an executable. You'll be able to find the most recent .py file on the main page, and the most recent .exe file in the most recent release!

The executable is a self-contained version of the deck tracker; it doesn't require you to download Python, or any of the libraries I use.
However, it is quite a bit larger since it needs to include the entire Python interpreter, and obviously isn't transparent (There's nothing in it that isn't in the python file, but you can never really be sure).

The python file will require you to install Python3 and PyQt5 (along with anything else that I'm importing that you don't have already), but is much smaller and you can read through the entire thing.
Also, you will need to download "condensed_card_library.txt" and have it in the same folder.


You should run the deck tracker in a dedicated folder (it creates a "config.txt" file that contains your personal preferences as well as your deck code and path to log file).
If you just run it in your downloads folder/desktop, you risk the config file becoming misplaced. Additionally, when updating, the .py and accompanying text files will automatically be downloaded.<br>

#### Please message me on Discord (JMoney#6100) if you have any comments/questions/suggestions!


## General Use<br>
Once you have the deck tracker up and running, you no longer need to set an active deck as of v3-0! Whenever you start a game, your current deck will automatically be updated!<br>

Once you're in a game, the top button will bring you to your opponents gudecks.com page, which will allow you to look at their decks if you want to.<br>

Finally, the settings page can be used to change the text font/size as well as transparency. 
Also, if your log folder is in a weird spot (or you aren't on Windows), you'll need to update the path to the file there. 
The path that you should provide is the folder above the folders where log files are kept (it should be ".../FuelGames" without the quotes). 
This will allow the tracker to automatically use the most recently modified folder, which means that you won't need to update every time the game changes.<br>


I believe that this should work with any OS that can run Python (which is pretty much anything normal), 
but if you're on Mac/Linux, I'd really appreciate if you tell me if it works or not for you!


## FAQs:<br>
- Q: My Deck Tracker crashes as soon as I open it!
A: That isn't a question, but try delteting your config.txt file. If that does work, please reach out to me at JMoney#6100 on Discord!
